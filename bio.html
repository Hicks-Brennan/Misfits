        <p>I have always had a passion for photography but finally pursued it professionally five years ago. My work is unique. I enjoy taking photos and turning them into works of art. Ever wanted super powers? I use professional software to digitally create your dream and make it a reality. I have created so many works of art including gig flyers, logos, book covers, as well as photographed weddings, babies, senior photos, sports teams, festivals, even a girl and her cat. I am excited to be a part of this team and expand my passion for art. Misfits is as quirky and awe inspiring as Peculiar Pixels. We are a match made in artistry heaven.</p>

        <p>I am a nurse by trade since 1983.  I’m a single parent of a special needs daughter.  I am her personal nurse 24/7. I have had the love of art as far back as I can remember.  I have worked in all mediums.  I started stained glass in the early 90’s. I got hooked on fused glass in 2011. I enjoyed it so much I got my own kiln that same year.  I have been creating ever since. </p>
